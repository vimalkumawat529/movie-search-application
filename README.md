# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Got a email from HR side for practical but i want to reference to design i don't have any idea

so could you complete the task and give me code using react and redux-toolkit

React.js Frontend Development Task: Movie Search Application

Task Description: You are tasked with creating a movie search application that allows users to
search for movies, view details about them, and browse related information such as cast,
ratings, and reviews. The application should utilize The Movie Database (TMDb) API to fetch
movie data and display it to users in an intuitive and visually appealing manner.
Requirements:

1. User Interface:
    Design a user interface that includes a search bar for entering movie queries and a display
   area for showing search results.
    Display basic movie information such as title, release date, poster image, and overview.
    Implement responsive design principles to ensure the application works well on both
   desktop and mobile devices.
2. Data Fetching and Management:
    Utilize The Movie Database (TMDb) API
   (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to fetch movie data based on user
   queries.
    Manage state effectively to store and update movie data based on user interactions.
    Handle loading and error states gracefully, providing feedback to users during data
   fetching.

3. Components and Modularity:
    Create reusable React components for different parts of the application, such as the search
   bar, movie display, and individual movie cards.
    Organize components in a modular and maintainable way to facilitate future
   enhancements or modifications.

4. User Experience:
    Provide autocomplete or suggestions for movie queries to improve user experience.
    Implement pagination or infinite scrolling to handle large sets of search results efficiently.
    Enhance the user interface with animations, transitions, or other visual effects to create a
   more engaging experience.
5. Additional Features (Optional, for extra credit):
    Implement movie filtering options based on genres, release year, or ratings.
    Add functionality to view additional details about a movie, such as cast members, trailers,
   and reviews.
    Incorporate user authentication and account features for saving favorite movies or
   creating watchlists.

6. Deployment:
    Deploy the application to a cloud platform (e.g., Netlify, Vercel) or hosting service of
   your choice.
    Provide clear instructions on how to run the application locally and access the deployed
   version.

Guidelines:
 Use modern JavaScript (ES6+) syntax and React best practices throughout the codebase.
 Follow a consistent coding style and adhere to industry-standard conventions.
 Write clear and concise documentation/comments where necessary to explain complex logic or
functionality.

 Test the application on different devices and screen sizes to ensure responsiveness.
 Aim for simplicity, efficiency, and scalability in your solution.
Evaluation Criteria: Candidates will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
 Completion of required features.
 Code quality, including readability, modularity, and adherence to best practices.
 User interface design and overall user experience.
 Effectiveness of data fetching and management.
 Responsiveness and compatibility across devices.
 Deployment strategy and documentation clarity.
Submission: Candidates should submit their solution as a Git repository (e.g., GitHub) containing the
source code and any necessary instructions/documentation. Additionally, they may provide a live demo
link if the application is deployed online.

Time limit is: 6 hours
